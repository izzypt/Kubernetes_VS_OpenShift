# OpenShift

OpenShift is RedHat's open source containar app platform for developing enterprise applications.

OpenShift has different flavours:

OpenShift is a Kubernetes-based container platform developed by Red Hat. It provides tools for automating application deployments, scaling, and management. OpenShift comes in several different versions depending on the hosting environment and use cases:

### 1. **OpenShift Dedicated**:
   - **What it is**: OpenShift Dedicated is a fully managed OpenShift cluster that Red Hat hosts and manages for you in a public cloud environment. It runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Red Hat is responsible for managing the infrastructure, the cluster, and operational support.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for organizations that want a managed OpenShift solution without the overhead of managing the underlying infrastructure and platform themselves.

### 2. **OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)**:
   - **What it is**: This is the self-managed version of OpenShift. It can be installed on-premises or in private, public, or hybrid cloud environments. Users are responsible for managing and maintaining the cluster.
   - **Use Case**: Best suited for organizations that want complete control over their OpenShift environment and can handle the complexity of managing both the platform and underlying infrastructure.

### 3. **OpenShift Online**:
   - **What it is**: OpenShift Online is Red Hat’s public cloud offering for developers to quickly start building and deploying containerized applications without worrying about infrastructure management. It’s essentially OpenShift as a service for individual developers or small teams.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for developers who want to focus on building applications and don’t need enterprise-scale infrastructure.

### 4. **OpenShift on Public Cloud (ROSA, ARO, etc.)**:
   - **What it is**: These are managed OpenShift offerings tightly integrated with public cloud providers.
     - **ROSA (Red Hat OpenShift on AWS)**: Managed OpenShift service running on AWS with deep AWS integration.
     - **ARO (Azure Red Hat OpenShift)**: A managed OpenShift service running on Microsoft Azure.
   - **Use Case**: These are ideal for organizations using cloud-native solutions and wanting seamless integration with their cloud providers' services.

### 5. **OpenShift Local (formerly CodeReady Containers)**:
   - **What it is**: OpenShift Local is a single-node, lightweight OpenShift environment for local development. It's designed for developers to test and build containerized applications on their local machines without needing a full multi-node OpenShift cluster.
   - **Use Case**: Perfect for developers who need an OpenShift environment for local development and testing.

### 6. **OpenShift Virtualization**:
   - **What it is**: A feature within OpenShift that allows running and managing virtual machines alongside containerized applications. It provides the ability to manage both virtualized and containerized workloads in a unified platform.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for organizations that have a mix of traditional VM workloads and modern containerized applications and want to manage both in a unified way.

Each type of OpenShift deployment serves different needs based on factors like scalability, management complexity, integration requirements, and whether the organization prefers to self-manage or rely on Red Hat’s managed services.

# Kubernetes_VS_OpenShift

OpenShift and Kubernetes are closely related, but there are some key differences between them, both in terms of features and deployment models. Here's a breakdown:

### **Differences Between Kubernetes and OpenShift**

1. **Kubernetes vs. OpenShift:**
   - **Kubernetes:** Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
   - **OpenShift:** OpenShift is an enterprise-grade platform built on top of Kubernetes, provided by Red Hat. It includes additional features for developers and operations teams, like a developer-friendly web console, integrated CI/CD pipelines, and security enhancements.

2. **Security and Policies:**
   - **Kubernetes:** Provides basic security features, but you need to set up and configure security policies manually.
   - **OpenShift:** OpenShift comes with more advanced security defaults, such as a stricter *SecurityContextConstraints* (SCC) policy, where containers run as non-root users by default. This prevents users from running containers with unnecessary privileges.

3. **Built-in Tools and Add-ons:**
   - **Kubernetes:** You’ll need to manually add and configure a variety of tools like Jenkins (CI/CD), Prometheus (monitoring), or Istio (service mesh).
   - **OpenShift:** OpenShift includes many of these tools out-of-the-box. For example, it integrates Jenkins pipelines for CI/CD and provides built-in monitoring, logging, and routing.

4. **Deployment Environment:**
   - **Kubernetes:** It supports deployment on various environments like GCP, AWS, Azure, and on-premise setups.
   - **OpenShift:** While OpenShift can also be deployed on various environments, it is highly optimized for Red Hat environments. It also comes in managed versions (like OpenShift Online or OpenShift Dedicated), which further simplifies management.

5. **Web Console:**
   - **Kubernetes:** Offers limited UI support (like dashboards), but most actions are handled via the `kubectl` CLI.
   - **OpenShift:** Has a full-fledged web console that makes it easier to manage applications, users, and resources. It’s more developer-friendly.

6. **Image Management:**
   - **Kubernetes:** Docker images are typically managed in external registries (Docker Hub, Nexus, etc.).
   - **OpenShift:** Comes with integrated image management and builds via OpenShift’s integrated *OpenShift Image Streams*. These provide a more structured and controlled way to manage images and updates.

### **Necessary Changes for Deploying Kubernetes Workloads on OpenShift**

1. **SecurityContext Constraints (SCC):**
   - In OpenShift, containers run under more restrictive security policies. You might need to adjust your `SecurityContext` or `PodSecurityPolicy` configurations if your Kubernetes deployment uses root privileges or specific capabilities.
   - OpenShift requires containers to run as non-root by default, so you may need to modify Dockerfiles or deployment manifests to ensure that your containers can run with non-root users.

2. **Routes vs Ingress:**
   - Kubernetes uses **Ingress** resources to expose services externally, while OpenShift uses **Routes**.
   - To deploy on OpenShift, you will either need to:
     - Convert your existing Kubernetes Ingress resources to OpenShift Routes, or
     - Enable OpenShift’s support for Kubernetes Ingress resources (which is optional).
   
3. **Persistent Storage:**
   - If you are using **PersistentVolumeClaims** (PVCs) in Kubernetes, these should generally work the same in OpenShift. However, OpenShift provides tighter integration with Red Hat’s storage solutions (like OpenShift Container Storage).
   
4. **Integrated Builds (Optional):**
   - OpenShift supports **BuildConfigs** that can automate the build process for Docker images from source code repositories. If your Kubernetes deployment uses pre-built images, you can either keep using external CI pipelines or switch to OpenShift's build pipeline to take advantage of their integrated CI/CD tools.

5. **Service Accounts and RBAC:**
   - OpenShift uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) similar to Kubernetes, but its defaults are stricter. You might need to review your roles and bindings to ensure the necessary permissions are in place for your services and applications.

6. **OpenShift-Specific Annotations:**
   - Some OpenShift features, like Routes and specific SCC configurations, may require additional annotations in your manifests to function correctly. You may need to add OpenShift-specific fields to the existing YAML files.

7. **Image Streams:**
   - If you want to use OpenShift's **Image Streams** instead of pulling directly from external Docker registries, you will need to adjust your deployment specs to reference the image streams.

### Summary of Key Changes:

- **SecurityContext:** Modify `SecurityContext` or adjust Dockerfiles for non-root execution.
- **Routes:** Replace Ingress with OpenShift Routes or enable Ingress in OpenShift.
- **RBAC:** Review and adjust Role-Based Access Controls to align with OpenShift policies.
- **BuildConfigs (Optional):** Leverage OpenShift’s build pipelines for integrated image builds.
- **Annotations:** Add OpenShift-specific annotations if needed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- K8's is open source project and OpenShift is an enterprise opensource product.

Adapting a Kubernetes setup to OpenShift mainly involves adjusting the manifests to account for the differences in how OpenShift operates compared to vanilla Kubernetes. While OpenShift is built on top of Kubernetes, it adds several features and imposes security constraints that require changes in resource definitions.

Here are the key differences in terms of manifests and their adaptation:

### 1. **Security Context and User Permissions**
   - **OpenShift’s stricter security model**: OpenShift enforces the use of non-root containers by default, whereas Kubernetes does not enforce such restrictions. In OpenShift, containers run with a randomized user ID (UID) to ensure enhanced security.
     - **Kubernetes**: You may have a pod running as root (`runAsUser: 0`).
     - **OpenShift**: You need to remove any explicit root user or `runAsUser` specification unless absolutely necessary, or assign a `SecurityContextConstraints (SCC)` that allows privileged containers.
     - Example modification:
       ```yaml
       securityContext:
         runAsUser: 1001  # In OpenShift, this should be omitted or set to a non-root user
       ```

### 2. **Service Types**
   - **Route in OpenShift**: OpenShift uses `Route` objects to expose services to the outside world, whereas Kubernetes uses `Ingress`. The `Route` resource is specific to OpenShift.
     - **Kubernetes**: Uses `Ingress` with an ingress controller.
     - **OpenShift**: Replace `Ingress` with `Route`.
     - Example of a Route definition in OpenShift:
       ```yaml
       apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
       kind: Route
       metadata:
         name: my-route
       spec:
         to:
           kind: Service
           name: my-service
         port:
           targetPort: 8080
       ```

### 3. **Image Streams**
   - **OpenShift Image Streams**: OpenShift supports `ImageStreams`, which provide versioned references to container images and facilitate image management.
     - **Kubernetes**: Pulls container images directly from DockerHub or a private registry.
     - **OpenShift**: You might use `ImageStreams` instead of pulling images directly in the deployment manifest.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
       kind: ImageStream
       metadata:
         name: my-app
       ```

### 4. **SecurityContextConstraints (SCC)**
   - **OpenShift SCC**: OpenShift uses `SecurityContextConstraints` (SCC) to define permissions for running pods, whereas Kubernetes uses `PodSecurityPolicies` (PSP). SCCs are more restrictive and require specific settings.
     - In OpenShift, you may need to assign your deployment an SCC if it needs special privileges (e.g., `privileged`, `anyuid`, etc.).
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       kind: SecurityContextConstraints
       apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
       metadata:
         name: custom-scc
       runAsUser:
         type: RunAsAny
       ```

### 5. **Persistent Storage**
   - **OpenShift Persistent Volumes**: OpenShift supports persistent volumes similar to Kubernetes, but it includes additional storage classes and plugins.
     - You may need to review the storage class in OpenShift to ensure compatibility.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       apiVersion: v1
       kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
       metadata:
         name: my-pvc
       spec:
         storageClassName: nfs
         accessModes:
           - ReadWriteOnce
         resources:
           requests:
             storage: 1Gi
       ```

### 6. **Pod Specifications and Annotations**
   - **Annotations for OpenShift features**: You may need to add specific annotations in your manifests to take advantage of OpenShift features (like auto-scaling, logging, or monitoring).
     - Example annotation for OpenShift monitoring:
       ```yaml
       metadata:
         annotations:
           openshift.io/monitoring: 'true'
       ```

### 7. **Network Policies**
   - **OpenShift SDN**: OpenShift uses its own SDN (Software-Defined Networking) by default. You may need to adapt your network policies, as OpenShift has different defaults for network isolation.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
       kind: NetworkPolicy
       metadata:
         name: allow-frontend
       spec:
         podSelector:
           matchLabels:
             role: frontend
         policyTypes:
         - Ingress
       ```

### 8. **RBAC and OAuth**
   - **OpenShift OAuth integration**: OpenShift integrates with OAuth and has a slightly different way of handling Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). You may need to update your RBAC rules, especially if you are integrating with OpenShift’s authentication.

### 9. **Deployment Strategies**
   - **Rolling Deployment with OpenShift**: While OpenShift supports Kubernetes-style `Deployments`, it also has its own `DeploymentConfig`, which offers more control over deployment strategies (like custom hooks).
     - If your setup uses `DeploymentConfig`, you need to ensure the Helm chart is compatible with both Kubernetes `Deployments` and OpenShift `DeploymentConfig`.
     - Example `DeploymentConfig`:
       ```yaml
       apiVersion: apps.openshift.io/v1
       kind: DeploymentConfig
       metadata:
         name: my-app
       spec:
         replicas: 3
         selector:
           app: my-app
         template:
           metadata:
             labels:
               app: my-app
           spec:
             containers:
             - name: my-container
               image: my-image
       ```

### Summary of Manifest Changes:
1. Remove or modify any `runAsUser` or root-level permissions to comply with OpenShift's security model.
2. Replace Kubernetes `Ingress` with OpenShift `Route`.
3. Use `ImageStreams` for image management if needed.
4. Define `SecurityContextConstraints` if your pods need elevated privileges.
5. Ensure storage classes and network policies are compatible with OpenShift.

By making these adaptations, you can transition from a Kubernetes environment to OpenShift more smoothly while taking advantage of OpenShift-specific features and security enhancements.
